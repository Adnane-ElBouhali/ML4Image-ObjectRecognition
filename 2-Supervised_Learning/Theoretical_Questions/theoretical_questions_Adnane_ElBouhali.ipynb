    "The choice of $\\pm$ is dictated by the original OLS coefficient's sign, demonstrating how the Lasso effectively adjusts the coefficient by either subtracting or adding $\\frac{\\lambda_1}{2}$, followed by applying the Ridge's proportionate shrinkage through $\\frac{1}{1+\\lambda_2}$. This illustrates the Elastic Net's nuanced balance between encouraging sparsity via the L1 penalty and ensuring stability through the L2 penalty.\n"
