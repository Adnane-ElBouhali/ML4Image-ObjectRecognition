# Machine Learning for Image and Object Recognition

This repository contains practical works (TPs) completed during the IMA205 course "Apprentissage pour l'image et la reconnaissance d'objets" (Machine Learning for Image and Object Recognition) at Télécom Paris.

## Course Overview

This course covers the main machine learning techniques for image analysis, including:

- Introduction to unsupervised learning (PCA, curse of dimensionality, ACP, ACI, NNMF)
- Introduction to supervised learning (overfitting, OLS, Ridge, LASSO, LDA, QDA)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision trees and random forests
- Ensemble learning
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
